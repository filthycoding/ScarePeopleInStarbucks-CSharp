# Scare people in Starbucks
or also
# Get kicked out of Starbucks

This little C# program is just supposed to make fun of people in coffee shops (especially Starbucks...)
that are scared of you being just the 1337 h4x0r you seem to be because you open your terminal and do
whatever you do in there.

## What does this even do lol
Well. It prints spaces, zeroes, ones, 'I's, 'i's, 'O's and 'o's to the screen in a green-on-black font.
Because only hackers do that. Haha.

Oh yeah and do whatever you want with it. This project is licensed under the WTFPL.<br>
